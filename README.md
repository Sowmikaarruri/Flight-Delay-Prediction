# Flight-Delay-Prediction
This project predicts flight delays using a deep learning model trained on U.S. domestic flight data. Built with TensorFlow/Keras, the model classifies flights as "On Time" or "Delayed" based on features like departure time, flight number, and schedule. The project includes a Streamlit-based web application
